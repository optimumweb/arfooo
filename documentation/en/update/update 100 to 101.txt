Below the various steps to update Arfooo Directory
From version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1


1) Make a backup of your database 
2) Deleted whole folder containing the files except Arfooo Directory: 
- Config/db.php 
- stylce.css your file if you have made changes 
3) Upload all files except Arfooo Directory folder "documentation". 
4) Once uploaded files, go to the following url: http://www.your-site.com/folderarfooo/install/update/ 

5) !!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!! 
6) Read the instructions if you could lose data, it is necessary to safeguard your database. 
7) ONLY 1 Click on the file "update101.php" 
8) Go to your directory in the part of visitors, not in admin parts, and see if strange characters appear. 

9) IF THE CHARACTERS ARE STRANGE AND ONLY IF THE CHARACTERS ARE STRANGE,  ITSELF 1 click on the file "fixdb.php" 
10) Delete the folder "install /" 



If after the upgrade, you are unable to log in to your account administrator 
Or if you have a blank page with an error 403, 404, 500 ... Then: 

Delete .htaccess the file in "admin/" and "moderation /" 
Delete .htacess main Arfooo Directory is replaced by the new. 

You have your set .htaccess depending on the specifics of your server. 

1) It may be that you had to remove the front # #RewriteBase/ 
2) You can also move your own. Htaccess at the root of your accommodation. 
Then it will settle Rewritebase / like that if you installed Arfooo Directory in the "Directory": 
Rewritebase /directory/ 
Or 
Rewritebase /directory
